# Optimizing Seismic Detection for Planetary Missions Across the Solar System

</div>

The exploration of seismic activity on distant planets holds the potential to reveal crucial information about their internal structures. However, detecting true seismic quakes amidst noise from environmental interference and spacecraft disturbances presents a significant challenge. We, team **ONURONON**, are addressing this problem as part of the **“Seismic Detection Across the Solar System”** challenge for NASA Space Apps Challenge 2024. Our mission is to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of seismic data transfer from celestial bodies like the Moon and Mars, while reducing energy consumption.

## Problem Statement

Planetary seismology missions struggle with the power requirements necessary to send continuous seismic data back to Earth. But only a fraction of this data is scientifically useful! Instead of sending back all the data collected, what if we could program a lander to distinguish signals from noise, and send back only the data we care about? Our challenge is to write a computer program to analyze real data from the Apollo missions and the Mars InSight Lander to identify seismic quakes within the noise!

## Objectives

- **Develop an algorithm** to analyze seismic data from the Apollo missions and Mars InSight Lander.
- **Filter noise and detect genuine seismic events** within the dataset.
- **Optimize energy usage** by transmitting only relevant seismic data.
- **Use machine learning techniques or conventional algorithms (e.g., STA/LTA)** to enhance detection accuracy.

## Solution Procedures

**We have developed a machine learning model** to solve the challange. The steps are described below:-

- Crutial for Building Safe Habitats on the Moon and Mars
  
## Resources
- **Earth Data from pyweed (train-dataset):** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nasiatfahim/earthquake-time-vs-velocity-dataset
- **NASA Provided Dataset (test-dataset):** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nasiatfahim/space-app-2024-official-dataset

## Usage
**The Jupyter Notebook contains detailed instructions on how to run the seismic analysis and visualize the data.** The provided algorithms can be modified to enhance the detection of seismic quakes or use machine learning models for more complex analysis.

## Future Work
**We plan to:**
- Further optimize the energy efficiency of the algorithm for real-time onboard use in future space missions.
- Explore additional machine learning techniques to improve detection in low signal-to-noise ratio environments.
- Implement adaptive learning capabilities that allow the system to improve its detection accuracy based on mission-specific data patterns over time.
- Collaborate with planetary scientists to refine the seismic event classification, ensuring the most scientifically valuable data is prioritized.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, Project **CoSeismic** by Team 'Onuronon' is an innovative approach to tackling the challenges of planetary seismology. By developing a simulation that enhances seismic data analysis while conserving energy, we aim to push the boundaries of space exploration. Our app-based solution not only addresses the limitations of real-time data collection but also makes the process more accessible and efficient. As we continue refining this technology, we look forward to contributing to safer and more successful space missions, paving the way for human life on other planets.
